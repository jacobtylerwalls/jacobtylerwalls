      <p><strong>Frayed Tethers</strong>&nbsp;(2018)</p>
      <p>for tenor saxophone and fixed media (10')</p>
      <details>
      <summary>Program note</summary>
      <p>
      This piece supposes that there is a way to unravel a sound that reveals its knotted components. The sounds of Matthew Levy’s saxophone are here teased apart and dealt with individually, like the intrusion of overtones upon a soft subtone note in the instrument’s lowest register, or the noisy breath artifacts that become harmonized by the instrument's air column. Saxophone sounds and synthetic sounds are layered against copies of themselves at extremely short intervals to amplify the “imperfections” in a sound that actually constitute their essences. These imperfections might give rise to shivering, quick pulses, or distortions that ring like two ceramic pots being rubbed together. Something that I imagine to be responsible for tethering the saxophone’s sound together is fraying and showing itself to you.

      <details>
      <summary>Program note</summary>
      <p>
      Flickers of melody and color compete for attention, overtake each other, shatter into pieces, and eventually reassemble over a pedal D in the cello: perhaps like a few breaths or exhalations over that single note. An occupation with the point at which timbral transformation becomes melody—where crossfading sonorities and slowly climbing harmonics create their own kind of counterpoint—animates the gestures and harmonic motion through to the very last moment.</p>

      <p>for saxophone quartet (9')</p>
      <details>
      <summary>Program note</summary><p>
      A still convergence is followed by an animated divergence. The two-part gesture repeats in like fashion, only with the convergence adopting the animation of the divergence and
      the divergence adopting further textural and timbral features. <i>Tachygenesis</i> is a phenomenon in developmental biology whereby already-established features (such as an organ)
      suddenly appear much earlier during maturation, often crowding out or abbreviating the development that used to take place there, thus creating room for new traits to appear
      in the newly-vacated developmental space. Even on a first hearing, I would hope that with each iteration of the two-part gesture, there is an audible sense of the convergence
      acquiring features of the divergence, in this way opening up ever more developmental space.</p>

      <p>for soprano voice, flute, violin, bass clarinet, and percussion (7')</p>
      <details>
      <summary>Program note</summary><p>
      This piece employs an excerpt from <i>Água Viva</i>, an evocative novel written entirely in the first person by the Brazilian author Clarice Lispector. Throughout, the voice reports on her inner state, the world, her memory, and the process of writing. (She even reports at one point that her writing is more like gesture than voice.) Much of it is written in an extremely intimate present tense. Some observations read like simple description, others like philosophy, most like a blend of the two. Continuous, enveloping paragraphs alternate with brutally short declarative sentences. Many times, in the course of developing an idea she will pursue it to its most grotesque intensification before then seeking refuge in a simple observation. In this work for TAK Ensemble I am interested in reproducing musically these qualities of the text, a text consisting more of gesture than voice.</p>

      <p><strong>Defeat Device</strong>&nbsp;(2016)</p>
      <p>for piano, electric bass, percussion (6')</p>
      <details>
      <summary>Program note</summary><p>
      In 2015 Volkswagen was caught fitting their vehicles with "defeat devices" in order to evade emissions tests. One email to engineers as litigation approached revealed an executive desperate for any plausible explanation for what was still taking place: <br>
      "Come up with the story, please!"<br></p>
      <p>
      At the outset, a simple process of insertions quickly defeats the sense of upbeat and downbeat. Throughout the piece I'm interested
      in developing these mechanically interlocking materials so that they "target" other elements of the music for "defeat." I'm also
      interested in having these mechanical materials accrue lyricism in the way their elements assemble in new configurations. I want these mechanical materials to be entangled, desperately trying to come up with the story.

      <summary>Program note</summary><p>
      <i>Piano Stretch</i> takes the sharply different soundworlds of inside-the-piano harmonics and spacious, resonant chords on the
      keyboard and considers them together. Some harmonics sound just as discrete as the notes played on the keys; some
      chords on the keys sound just as microtonal as the complex harmonics found inside the piano. The pianist must stretch
      to reach everything, and in some sense the piano itself must stretch as well.</p>

      <p>for full orchestra</p>
      <details>
      <summary>Program note</summary>
      <p>
      I started work on this piece after encountering the fifth movement of Hans Otte’s <i>Das Buch der Klange </i>(The Book of Sounds), an hour-long suite for solo piano. I first heard the movement in Jean-Luc Godard’s 2004 film <i>Notre Musique</i>, where it was presented as the sole audio for the film’s
      brief first act, a catalogue of images of war and suffering without commentary. What was arresting about the music was its harmonic palette—of a kind with Messiaen’s, yet flirting with jazz—and its expression within an unrelenting ostinato. I began imagining the possibilities of a music that would likewise deploy dense, dissonant, yet still distantly familiar harmonies within a heavily rhythmic framework.</p><p>
      The title mixes two metaphors found in Wagner's prose on overture form: referring to a closed ending he composed for Gluck's overture to <i>Iphegenia in Aulis</i>, Wagner claimed that he brought the main themes to an armistice, "though no full peace," and referring to Mozart's overture to <i>Don Giovanni</i>,
      he lauded its "transfiguring light of music as a passion personified in tones."
